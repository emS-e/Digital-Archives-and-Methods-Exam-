######################################## TASK TWO


# Task 2: Read in the googlesheet data you and your colleagues created
# into your DANmap object (with 11 background layers you created in Task 1).

# Solution

# Activating the libraries 
library(tidyverse)
library(googlesheets4)
library(leaflet)

######################################## TASK THREE

# Task 3: Can you cluster the points in Leaflet?
# Hint: Google "clustering options in Leaflet in R"

# Solution

OUTmap <- leaflet() %>% 
  addTiles() %>% 
  addMarkers(lng = OUTplaces$Longitude, 
             lat = OUTplaces$Latitude,
             popup = paste(OUTplaces$Placename, "<br>", OUTplaces$Type))
OUTmap
saveWidget(OUTmap, "OUTmap.html", selfcontained = TRUE)

######################################## TASK FOUR

# Task 4: Look at the two maps (with and without clustering) and consider what
# each is good for and what not.

# Your brief answer

# ANSWER: 
# The one without cluster can be used for a general overview of the area. Though it does not display any direct information. 
# The map with the clusters provides further insight to the coordinates that show the filming locations of the show Outlander, which were filmed in Scotland. 


######################################## TASK FIVE

# Task 5: Find out how to display the notes and classifications column in the map. 
# Hint: Check online help in sites such as 
# https://r-charts.com/spatial/interactive-maps-leaflet/#popup

# Solution

# Solution can be found in task 3, and this code did it: 
#(popup = paste(OUTplaces$Placename, "<br>", OUTplaces$Type)
